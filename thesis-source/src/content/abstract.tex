This paper presents the design and practical implementation of a C code generator module for the Gamma Statechart Composition Framework. The module serves as a vital component in the development of embedded systems software, offering seamless generation of C code from statecharts and compositions of statecharts. By leveraging the existing low-level statechart descriptors, particularly the XSTS language, the code generator module significantly simplifies the process of transforming high-level statechart models into executable C code, simplifying the process of developing embedded systems software. The resulting code is designed to be instantly compilable and can support a diverse range of hardware architectures.
