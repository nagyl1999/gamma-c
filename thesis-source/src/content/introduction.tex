Code generation is becoming an increasingly popular approach for developing embedded systems software, particularly in the context of critical systems where safety and reliability are paramount. While it is crucial to design and verify embedded systems to ensure the aforementioned parameters, it is not enough; bugs and errors can still find their way into the code during implementation, making code generation an important tool for reducing human error.

This paper introduces a C code generator module for the Gamma Statechart Composition Framework designed to solve the issue of potential mistakes during implementation by eliminating the need for manual coding. Moreover, the generated code will always be consistent with the statecharts used for its creation, ensuring that the resulting software functions as intended and is easier to maintain.

Code generators are a fascinating technology due to the fact that they enable developers to separate the logical design of a software system from its implementation, therefore enabling platform-independent solutions that can be easily adapted to a variety of hardware architectures.

In conclusion, the C code generator module presented in this paper is aimed to minimize the occurrence of human errors during the implementation process, possibly even eliminating them altogether. With the ability to compile instantly on a wide variety of hardware architectures, developers across different domains can use the C code generator module to generate code that meets their specific needs, whether it be for aerospace, automotive, medical devices, or any other domain where reliable software is a must.
